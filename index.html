            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>This league will be a league where players will have fun and no BS involved. As a player I always wanted to play in a league with my friends and teammates in the Summer, but I never wanted to drive to the South Shore. This is a perfect spot
                to be able to bond with teammates prior to the season or even to be able to meet new players. Each team will be coached by a Professional hockey player and the plan is to be able to spread knowledge of the game and help them become better
                players before they start their next season. Some players may be exposed to higher level players which will help push them to be better, and maybe even learn some cool new tricks.</p>
